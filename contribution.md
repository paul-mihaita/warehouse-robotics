#Thomas Taylor, Team 2.5

* Warehouse Management Interface: 100%
* Integration: 50%
  * Primarily Alex and I worked together to help integrate the server with the GUI to send Jobs and routes to the robots. I did all of the PC side for integration and he did all the robot integration
* Job assignment: 90%
  * While implementing the Job selection I also did a lot of the assignment.

#Team feedback

* Ravinder 
  * Excellent team leader. Gave help to anyone who wanted it and we very encouraging and motivated.
* Alex
  * Give him good marks please. Me and him worked really hard on getting the majority of the project working together and the project wouldn't of worked at all without him.
* Jack
  * I feel that he could've maybe put a little more work in but he did his part and the code that he wrote was readable and worked
* Paul
  * Couldn't understand his code but I saw a massive improvement in efficiency and he helped me a lot by giving me what I wanted from him really quickly for integration and was a really nice guy.
* Maria
  * Can't really comment on what she wrote as I avoided the robots as much as possible but the final GUI seemed to work and she turned up to team meetings and gave good input
* Narae
  * It seemed she put work in but the code she got out was useless and gave compile errors for the entirety of the project. Ravinder gave her lots of help and so we got the Job selection code in the end but it was very basic and I'm not sure how much was actually written by her.
